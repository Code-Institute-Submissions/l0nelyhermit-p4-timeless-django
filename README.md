Currently the project is to display CRUD functions under this website
Inclusive of user login or logout feature is installed

### Disclaimer
Posts and listings populated by the various users as seen on the forum  are mainly used for the presentation of the demo.Therefore, the users that were being used are the different accounts that I have made to used to populate the forum and are not actual users of the forum.

### Flask
The web framework used in the development of the webpage that is reponsible for the key essential features such as routing, validation of forms and implementing key functions of the webpage. 

### Backend Tools
1. Django

## Programming Methodology
### Form Validation
Upon submission of a form, there will be validation in place that is handled through condition checkers. An error accumulator which is a dictionary is used to store the errors and if the error accumulator has received errors, the user will be notified through a danger toastr message of a failed form submission.

### Security Control
- Through the use of .env file, important and sensitive data such as secret keys are carefully hidden away so that they are not leaked into the publc.
- Passlib library is used to encrypt passwords when the password is saved into the database to prevent unauthorized personnel from retrieving the passwords easily upon access to the database

### Source Control
- Github is used to track and manage any changes in the development of the project



## Testing
All testing was carried out manually and the results of the testing are shown below:
| Test Number | Event                                                   | Expected Observation                      | Actual Observation             |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1           | Home screen > click SHOP > <SELECTED BRAND>             | display selected watches of the <BRAND>   | *Pass*                         |
| 2           | Home screen > click SELL YOUR WATCH > <SELL MY WATCH>   | show form for user to entry and submit    | *Pass*                         |
| 3           | Home screen > click SELL YOUR WATCH > <VIEW MY LISTINGS>| show all watches                          | *Pass*                         |
| 4           | (show_post) route > click <modify>                      | show form for user to modify data & submit| *Pass*                         |
| 5           | (show_post) route > click <remove>                      | remove from databases                     | *Pass*                         |

 
### Responsiveness
Using the inspector function of Google Chrome, the following devices was used in the testing phase for mobile responsiveness:
- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5
- Pixel 2
- Pixel 2 XL
- iPhone 5/SE
- iPhone 6/7/8
- iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
- iPhone X
- IPad
- Ipad Pro

In the testing of responsiveness to both phone and tablet devices, the webpage application is able to display and layout the correct intended design for the different
pages when tested through these different platforms.

### Bugs
- If users upload many images into the create listing or edit listing form, only the latest image will be taken into the database.
